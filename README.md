# Computer Graphics Sessional

This repository contains my implementations of key computer graphics concepts and interactive OpenGL demos.

## Contents

- **Basic OpenGL**  
  A functional analog clock and interactive magic cube.

- **Rasterization Pipeline**  
  Manual implementation of the rasterization pipeline, including transformations, clipping, and scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm.

- **Ray Tracing**  
  A basic ray tracer from scratch to generate realistic images for a few geometric shapes (an infinite checkerboard, pyramids, spheres, cubes) with appropriate illumination and reflection techniques.

## Technologies

- C++  
- OpenGL (GLUT)
